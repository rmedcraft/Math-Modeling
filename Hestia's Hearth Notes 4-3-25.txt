Seems like there should be multiple busiest months (summer & December)
Same with lowest months, (September, January)

hot and cold drinks seem to even out
Average customers seems to even out over the week, less over the week & more over the weekend.

things that are consistent from day to day or from week to week likely dont need to be modeled. They probably average out to a single number. 

cant really compare Wednesday to a Saturday, but you can compare a Saturday to a Saturday. Things are consistent across weeks. 

TODO OVER THE WEEKEND: 
- DAILY PREDICTED CUSTOMERS START AT A MONTH OTHER THAN JANUARY
- HELP KEVIN
